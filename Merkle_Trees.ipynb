    "Suppose you had a list with some entries and some party wanted to access some entries of the list. The caveat is that they want proof that the entry is definitely from the list and not forged by you. How would you go about doing it? One common way is to have what we call a hash checksum, and we can send the entire list along with the checksum, so that they can access the entry while knowing that it is valid. The question now is, what do we do if the list is large, say containing millions of rows of data? Is it viable to send the entire list and checksum, just so the other person can access a few entries? A solution we can use is merkle trees. Merkle trees are a type of hashing a list, database, or anything that offers a type of commitment. Once the sender hashes the tree, they're commiting to that tree and can't modify it, like a checksum. The main diffrence with a merkle tree is that you can send the checksum, the entry and a proof that the entry is from the checksummed database. We will go over the proof later below\n",
